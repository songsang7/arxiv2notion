# Arxiv2Notion

Arxiv2Notion is an automated tool that searches for newly published papers on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org), checks their relevance to your research, and logs them neatly into your Notion database.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- **Daily Search:**
  Runs every day at **9:00 AM KST** (customizable via the GitHub Actions workflow `.yml` file).

- **Keyword Matching:**
  Searches arXiv using a list of user-defined keywords in `arxiv_to_notion.py`. Keywords with hyphens (e.g., `few-shot`) are handled appropriately.

- **Smart Filtering:**
  Uses **Google Gemini models** to:
  - **Summarize abstracts**
  - **Determine relevance** to your research (`Related` / `Unrelated`)

- **Duplicate Handling:**
  Automatically filters out previously processed papers to avoid duplication.

## 🧠 Gemini Models

The following Gemini models are used in sequence to support higher request rates (up to 45 RPM or 1550 RPD depending on your tier):

## ⚙️ Configuration

The script can be configured via `arxiv_to_notion.py` and GitHub Action secrets.

### 🔐 GitHub Secrets
- You should register these 3 parameters in `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> New repository secret`

## 🗃️ Notion Table Structure
- You should consider property type when you add column in your database table.

| Column Name                   | Property Type | Description                                      |

| Abstract                     | text           | Full abstract (via Gemini)                      |
| Relatedness                  | select         | Whether the paper is related to your research   |
| Date                         | date           | Publication date on arXiv                       |
| URL                          | url            | Direct link to the arXiv paper                  |
| Author                       | text           | Authors of the paper                            |
| Motivation                   | text           | Motivation of the paper                         |
| Differences from Prior Work  | text           | Differences from Prior Work                     |

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

0. After issuing `Notion_TOKEN`, [link your api with your notion page that your database table exists](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration)(refer to   `Give your integration page permissions` Section in link)
1. **Fork/clone** this repository.
2. Set the following secrets in **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:
   - `NOTION_TOKEN`
   - `DATABASE_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
3. Modify `KEYWORDS`, `LOOKBACK_DAYS`, and `MY_RESEARCH_AREA` in `arxiv_to_notion.py`.
4. Afterward, you should add each colum in your database table(in your page) with appropriate property type by manually.(`Paper`, `Abstract`, `Relatedness`, ... `Results`)
5. That's it! The script will run daily via GitHub Actions.
